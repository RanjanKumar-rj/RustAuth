Axum-based authentication project :

Built an authentication microservice in Rust using the Axum web framework. It supports user signup with hashed passwords, login with secure password verification, and JWT-based session management. The service integrates with a PostgreSQL database and uses industry-standard security practices like Argon2 for hashing and JWTs for stateless authentication.
